        <h2 id="first-post">How To Say No: 3 Tiny Notes To Help</h2>
        <p>I often think we are usually wondering less about how to say no and more about questions like; Am I allowed to say no? How can I possibly say no to this person I always say yes to? What will people think if I start saying no? What is the excuse I am going to offer for saying no? How can I stop feeling guilty when I want to say no?

Maybe it’s a combination of all of those things. The idea of saying no, especially without a well-crafted explanation or excuse brings up a bunch of feelings. You may experience everything from joy, excitement and freedom to dread, guilt and remorse.

</p>
        <h3>8 Tiny notes to help you say no (with more ease and less guilt)</h3>
        <p>
            One of the reasons we feel guilty about saying no is that we are so used to doing anything we can NOT to disappoint others, even if that means disappointing ourselves. Confrontation isn’t fun for most of us either so instead of saying no, we say yes only to notice regret and resentment rise up. There are some examples of how to say no to people here, but what we don’t need is a brilliant excuse. “No thank you” or “Thanks for thinking of me, I’m going to pass” both work very well. Per usual, less is best.

            <li class="notes">Say no to shutting down your feelings.</li>
            When you think about how to say no to your feelings, remember that we can’t escape ourselves and the sooner we realize that we don’t have to fix our feelings, the sooner we can notice that for the most part, they come and go. Some need our attention. Some don’t. And the ones that do need our attention don’t need us to numb them or shove them down, they simply ask us to take care, to slow down, to be gentle.
            <li class="notes">Say no to fixing, saving and controlling.</li>
            Think of all the energy you save when you know how to say no to running around making sure everything is ok and yes to just standing there shining. And doesn’t it make sense that the more we protect our time and energy, the more we have to give to ourselves which will allow us to shine even more brightly? And when we are shining brightly, won’t we have more capacity to help our people and communities, take care of ourselves and enjoy our lives? Say no to running around and yes to being a lighthouse.
            <li class="notes">You have to say no to you too.</li>
            Before you worry about how to say no to anyone else, say no to yourself. Say no to adding one more thing to your to-do list. If it’s already too long, rewrite it in order of priority, tear it in half and throw the bottom half away. Sometimes, when our lists are too long we either get distracted with the idea that there is too much to do, or we feel like we aren’t good enough because we don’t get enough done. This measurement system is broken.

        <p id="quote">I don't say "no" because 
            <br>I'm so busy,
            <br>I say "no" because 
            <br>I don't want to be so busy.

        <h2 id="second-post">Spend Less Time on Your Phone with These Little Tricks</h2>
        
        <p> If you are wondering how to spend less time on your phone but you can’t stop looking at your phone, you are not alone. On average, we are spending four – five hours a day on our mobile devices. That’s more than a full day a week! We tend to underestimate our usage too. Even though the data is trackable, it’s hard to see and easier to avoid. 

<br>
<br>If you are sick of scrolling or want to avoid the regret that comes in a few years from choosing your phone over your life, I have some time-saving tricks for you. This isn’t to say that phones are bad, only that losing control over the time you spend on your phone isn’t great.
    </p>
    <p>And here are tricks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Turn off all notifications except for phone or text.</li>
        <li>Be honest about how much time you spend on your phone.</li>
        <li>Follow fewer people on media to spend less time on your phone.</li>
        <li>Find something that matters more.</li>
    </ul>
