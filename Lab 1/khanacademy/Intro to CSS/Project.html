            Switzerland is a poet’s muse, and there is a little bit of magic in almost all its corners. That’s how the beauty of this place will inspire you to travel more; it is a bag full of the most delightful surprises. If Switzerland is on your mind and you are a first timer, here are the places you shouldn’t miss.
        </p>
        <h2>Beautiful places in Switzerland for first-timers</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><h3><em>Lucerne</em></h3></li>

        <p>
            It’s one of the <strong>prettiest</strong> places in Switzerland, surrounded by lush mountains, and where cars are not allowed, making it perfect for those who love walks. Further, the magnificent lake that shares its name with the city adds to the charm of this Swiss jewel! Visit this place for reasons more than sightseeing, and you will go back with a bag full of beautiful memories and mementoes.
        </p>
        <li><h3><em>Zermatt</em></h3></li>

        <p>
            Zermatt is another <strong>fairyland</strong> here, where no motorised vehicles are allowed, and you can easily hop on to a carriage for ease. It is a gem of a place, except that it is a lot prettier, dotted with fancy restaurants, authentic and welcoming Swiss chalets, souvenir stores, entirely pedestrianised cobbled streets, and luxury stays.
        </p>
        <li><h3><em>Lauterbrunnen</em></h3></li>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Lauterbrunnen3.JPG/1200px-Lauterbrunnen3.JPG" alt="Lauterbrunnen city" width="200">
        <p>
            Lauterbrunnen is a quintessential Swiss village, and with as many as 72 waterfalls, it truly justified its name which roughly translates into <em>‘several fountains’</em>. This Alpine gem is surrounded by vibrant meadows and breathtaking peaks, and is a place where one gets to witness the raw beauty of nature and picture-perfect Swiss settings.
