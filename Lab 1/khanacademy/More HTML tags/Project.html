        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Warm the olive oil in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium heat. One-fourth cup olive oil may seem like a lot, but it adds a lovely richness and heartiness to this nutritious soup.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once the oil is shimmering, add the chopped onion and carrot and cook, stirring often, until the onion has softened and is turning translucent, about 5 minutes.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add the garlic, cumin, curry powder and thyme. Cook until fragrant while stirring constantly, about 30 seconds. Pour in the drained diced tomatoes and cook for a few more minutes, stirring often, in order to enhance their flavor.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pour in the lentils, broth and the water. Add 1 teaspoon salt and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Season generously with freshly ground black pepper. Raise heat and bring the mixture to a boil, then partially cover the pot and reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the lentils are tender but still hold their shape.

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Put your meat and 1/2 the onion in a deep enough dish to cover it with cold water leaving enough space on the top so that it doesn't boil over.
Bring to the boil, constantly removing the foam, Reduce heat to simmer when it starts to boil. Cover it.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Let it cook for about 2 1/2 hours or until the meat is tender and falling off the bone.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> 20 minutes before your meat is ready, add carrots and potatoes without cutting. 
        </p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Several minutes before your meat is ready, add the other half of the onion (cut in ring shapes), salt and pepper to taste, into your stock.
